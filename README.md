## About elevators

### links
first of all there are some intresting links that helped us to understand more about how elevators are functioning, and through them we got some insperation

## On-line vs. Off-line

Until this project we were assuming that elevators only reach to their source and destination at the moment we press the button, But now we see that it is more comleceted then that. Further more, now we are acknolaged that due to the technological advantage we can nowpick the destination floor from the source floor and moreover, there are apps that can help us scedual forward calls - those eleberate elevators commonly knon as "Smart Elevator".
let us differ the 2 way to call an elevator, a smart one. We will explian the logic and algorithm behind them.

### Online Algorithm
Online is the more common algorithm nowadays.
the Online way is to deal with call at the moment they are being called, they are more "live" then the other way.
For Example: I am up to attend a meeting int 5 minutes at floor 59, I am currently at the Lobby level (the floor 0). There are other peaple at diffrent levels, assumed to be a guy named "Mathew", he wants to go from the 3rd flr to the 55th flr, other, "Jane Doe" is as level 47 and want to reach the -2 floor (the Parking-lot).
The elevators will calculate for each call, the shortest and the safest the route from their current floor to their destinations.

<a name="online_exp"></a>
#### How are they doing that?
This is OUR algorithm:
1. The elevetors are sorted by: 
	- goes up
	- gous down
	- resting elevators
2. For each new call tat recived we check the direction of the call (if goes up or down)
3. We runs on all of the elevators that has the same direction or in resting mode.
**Note 1:** if all the elevator are allocated with the same direction we will let one elevator to be for the other direction.
**Note 2:** we choose the first elevator to be comapared by random, we ensure this action, that of the all elevators have got allocated
4. For Each elevator we check if the source and destination floors are in the bounderies of itself, olso we check if it doesn't reached to the maximum stops that it capable to have (the maximum stops is the range of theelevator (high floor - low floor)).
5. We now compare the elevators by who has the lowes time ro reach from its current position to the source floor and then from the source floor to the destination floor.
	*curr postition ----> source floor ----> destination floor*
7. After we found our winner elevator, we will save those sourc and destination floors as the stops of the elevator (in sorted way: up - regularly, down- reversed)

### Offline Algorithm
This mode is diffrent, assumed to be an app that links the phone to the elevator, we can scadual a call to pick us at wanted moment.
The offline mode gets all the future calls, and when they are excpected to be made.

#### How are they doing that?
The Base algorithm is very similar to the Online mode [(read more about online algorithm)](#online_exp).
The big diffrence, that in the online being handled live while the offline mode only give the allocation.
OUR algorithm work like that:
1. For each new call simulate all the elevtors movments, run then to the given time stamp
2. perform as the [(online algorithm)](#online_exp) for each call, and set the best allocation for thus elevator
